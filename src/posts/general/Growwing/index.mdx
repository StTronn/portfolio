# Exposure

Well I met a lot of intresting and inspiring folks and working with them is going quite good. Also I realized in a few days that
there is so much out there and I know so little. I was quite paralyzed by this like I kept saying to my self not in a million years I am grasping this.
It is just way out of my hands. This did drop my productivity a lot I just kept on overthinking stuff was even afraid to open one more file
as this will add more complexity.

### The Dilema

** In my past year I came to the conclusion that I will learn by doing but How can I learn all this by doing It is impossible. **

** There so much to Learn Where Do I start What's the best way How do I manage my time **

Well I do think that I was overcompliating things here is a quote that helped me

> When I set out to tackle something – to solve some problem or create something new – in the beginning, it just seems insurmountable. When you enter a new field, you don't know anything; you don't even know what people are talking about! It sounds like it's a foreign language that people are speaking. But, I know from my experiences – going back to my five year-old self – that if I just persevere, if I keep going in this direction, eventually I'll start seeing what resembles a branch or a trunk, and then a leaf or two, and then I can start putting them together. Eventually, I'll see the whole tree. I just know that's the process. I try to repeat it often enough so it becomes a habit.

> The most common advice for literally anything you want to achieve is - do small bits of work, be consistent, have patience.

>It’s frustrating how straightforward the advice is, but so hard to implement (simple, not easy)

Well Given my generation time span This is the most I can write. Will not touch on Time managment and Balance quite bad at it.

If you read through all this boring stuff let me tell you one thing It's exciting :)
